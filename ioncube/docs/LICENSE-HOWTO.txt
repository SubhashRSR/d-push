                    The ionCube Encoder - Version 14.0
                    ----------------------------------

LICENSING THE ENCODER
=====================

The Encoder software comes with an allocation of 1 or more licenses.
Each license can be activated on any machine with an active Ethernet network
adapter as explained below.

Licenses can be obtained automatically via the Internet if a license slot
is available for use. A license can be deactivated over the Internet
if you need to move the license to a different machine. The license
should also be deactivated before making changes to the machine 
(e.g. switching OS).


To activate a license over the Internet
---------------------------------------

First:

* Be sure that you have installed the Encoder in the location where you wish
  use it permanently as moving a licensed Encoder can invalidate the license.
  A location such as /usr/local may be better than a user Home directory. 
  The location must be writeable during the licensing process so the license
  file can be created and updated.

* If all licenses are in use and you have another machine which needs 
  licensing then you can deactivate a license on a machine you no
  longer require or purchase an additional license.

* Check that you have an active Internet connection. 

Then:

* Run with the option --activate, e.g.

  ./ioncube_encoder.sh --activate


To deactivate a license over the Internet
-----------------------------------------

First:

* Be sure that the Encoder install directory is writeable.

* Check that you have an active Internet connection. 

Then:

* Run with the option --deactivate, e.g.

  ./ioncube_encoder.sh --deactivate

  
  After a few seconds the Encoder should say that the license has been
  released.
