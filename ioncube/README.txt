Using Encoded Files - the ionCube Loader
========================================

A free component called the ionCube Loader is available from ioncube.com
to process encoded files. Loaders are available for many platforms, and
with ionCube being the most widely used industry standard for securing
PHP files, many hosting servers have the Loader component pre-installed
or available as an option via a control panel.

If a manual installation of the Loader is required, this is usually
straightforward and quick to do. See our YouTube video for a walkthrough
of installation on a Linux cloud server.

A PHP script called the Loader Wizard is also avaiable, which analyses a
server and gives install guidance based on various factors.

Loaders can be downloaded from https://loaders.ioncube.com


What Next?

The User Guide PDF explains all available features, and starts with some simple

Further topics such as license file creation and an API in the Loader are

running it with the --help option will give a summary of all available options.
